## Hot Fix Criteria

### Qualifying Factors
- Critical business impact
- Production system affected
- No viable workaround
- Immediate action required

### Priority Levels
1. **Emergency**
   - System down
   - Data corruption
   - Security breach
   - Revenue impact

2. **Critical**
   - Major function
   - Multiple users
   - Performance
   - Compliance

## Best Practices

### Process Guidelines
- Maintain code quality
- Minimize scope
- Complete testing
- Clear communication
- Proper documentation

### Quality Controls
- Code review required
- Test coverage
- Regression checks
- Deployment validation
