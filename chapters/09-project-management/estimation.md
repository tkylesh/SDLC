# Estimation Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the estimation processes and best practices used at Trexis Systems for accurately sizing and planning work items.

## Story Point Estimation

### Fibonacci Scale
```markdown
Points | Complexity
-------|------------
1      | Trivial change, well-understood
2      | Simple task, minimal risk
3      | Small feature, clear requirements
5      | Medium feature, some unknowns
8      | Complex feature, significant unknowns
13     | Large feature, high complexity
21     | Epic-sized, needs breakdown
```

### Estimation Process
1. **Preparation**
   - Review requirements
   - Identify dependencies
   - Consider technical debt
   - Assess risks

2. **Team Planning**
   - Planning poker sessions
   - Group discussion
   - Expert consultation
   - Consensus building

3. **Refinement**
   - Historical comparison
   - Velocity adjustment
   - Risk factor inclusion
   - Confidence level

## Time-Based Estimation

### Effort Categories
```markdown
Category    | Time Range    | Usage
------------|---------------|-------
Quick Fix   | 0-4 hours    | Simple bugs, minor changes
Small Task  | 4-8 hours    | Basic features, known scope
Medium Task | 1-3 days     | Complex features
Large Task  | 3-5 days     | System changes
Extra Large | 5+ days      | Major features, needs breakdown
```

### Time Estimation Process
1. **Task Analysis**
   - Break down requirements
   - Identify sub-tasks
   - Consider dependencies
   - Account for meetings

2. **Effort Calculation**
   - Development time
   - Testing effort
   - Review cycles
   - Documentation
   - Buffer allocation

## Capacity Planning

### Team Capacity
```markdown
Activity           | Time Allocation
------------------|----------------
Development       | 60-70%
Meetings          | 10-15%
Code Review       | 10-15%
Documentation     | 5-10%
Support/Other     | 5-10%
```

### Sprint Planning
1. **Available Hours**
   - Team size
   - Working days
   - Time off
   - Holidays

2. **Allocation**
   - Story points
   - Task hours
   - Buffer time
   - Support duties

## Velocity Tracking

### Metrics Collection
```markdown
Sprint Metric    | Description
----------------|-------------
Planned Points  | Points committed
Completed Points| Points delivered
Carry Over     | Incomplete work
Added Items    | Mid-sprint additions
Blockers      | Impediment impact
```

### Analysis
1. **Trends**
   - Historical velocity
   - Completion rate
   - Estimation accuracy
   - Team performance

2. **Adjustments**
   - Capacity updates
   - Process improvements
   - Team optimization
   - Tool enhancements

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Factors
1. **Technical**
   - Complexity
   - Dependencies
   - New technology
   - Technical debt

2. **Business**
   - Requirements clarity
   - Stakeholder availability
   - Priority changes
   - Market factors

### Estimation Adjustment
```markdown
Risk Level | Buffer
-----------|--------
Low        | +10%
Medium     | +20%
High       | +30%
Critical   | +50%
```

## Best Practices

### Estimation Guidelines
1. **Be Realistic**
   - Consider all factors
   - Include buffer time
   - Account for unknowns
   - Use historical data

2. **Team Involvement**
   - Get diverse input
   - Use collective wisdom
   - Build consensus
   - Share knowledge

3. **Regular Review**
   - Track accuracy
   - Adjust estimates
   - Learn from history
   - Improve process

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Avoid**
   - Optimistic estimates
   - Pressure influence
   - Ignored risks
   - Hidden complexity

2. **Address**
   - Unclear requirements
   - Missing dependencies
   - Resource constraints
   - Technical limitations
