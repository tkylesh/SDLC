## Overview
This document outlines the processes and best practices for identifying, assessing, and managing project risks to ensure successful project delivery.

## Risk Identification

### Risk Categories
```markdown
Category        | Examples
----------------|----------
Technical       | Architecture, performance, security
Business        | Requirements, market, compliance
Resource        | Skills, availability, turnover
External        | Vendors, regulations, market
```

### Identification Process
1. **Risk Sources**
   - Project review
   - Team input
   - Historical data
   - Expert judgment

2. **Documentation**
   - Clear description
   - Root causes
   - Early indicators
   - Potential impact

## Impact Assessment

### Impact Matrix
```markdown
Impact Level | Business Effect    | Technical Effect   | Schedule Effect
-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------
Critical     | Business stop     | System failure    | Major delay
High         | Service degraded  | Feature broken    | Sprint delay
Medium       | Function limited  | Performance issue | Task delay
Low          | Minor impact      | Simple fix       | Minor delay
```

### Probability Assessment
```markdown
Probability | Description           | Likelihood
------------|----------------------|------------
Very High   | Almost certain       | 80-100%
High        | Likely to occur      | 60-80%
Medium      | Possible occurrence  | 40-60%
Low         | Unlikely to occur    | 20-40%
Very Low    | Rare occurrence     | 0-20%
```

## Mitigation Strategies

### Strategy Types
```markdown
Strategy    | Description          | Use Case
------------|---------------------|----------
Avoid       | Eliminate threat    | High risk
Mitigate    | Reduce impact      | Medium risk
Transfer    | Share risk         | Specific risk
Accept      | Monitor risk       | Low risk
```

### Implementation
1. **Strategy Development**

### Plan Components
```markdown
Component        | Description
-----------------|-------------
Trigger Events   | Risk indicators
Response Plan    | Action steps
Resources        | Required support
Communication    | Update process
```

### Plan Types
