## Overview
This document outlines the database deployment procedures at Trexis Systems, ensuring safe and controlled database changes across all environments.

## Deployment Workflow

### Environment Flow
```markdown

Integration   | QA            | Full testing
Validation    | Staging       | Final verify
Production    | Prod          | Live system
```

### Process Flow
```markdown
Step          | Action         | Responsible
--------------|---------------|------------
1            | Script prep    | Developer
2            | Dev deploy     | Developer
3            | QA deploy      | DBA
4            | Stage deploy   | DBA
5            | Prod deploy    | Senior DBA
6            | Verification   | Team
```

## Environment Procedures

### Development
```markdown
Task          | Description    | Responsible
--------------|---------------|------------

   - Integration test
   - Performance check
   - Documentation

### Staging
1. **Pre-deployment**
   - Environment sync
   - Final review
   - Team readiness
   - Backup verify
   - Access check

2. **Deployment**
   - Controlled execution
   - Full validation
   - Performance test
   - Security check
   - Documentation

### Production
1. **Planning**

   - Team schedule
   - Backup strategy
   - Rollback plan
   - Communication

2. **Execution**
   - Production backup
   - Script deployment
   - Validation steps
   - Performance verify
   - Status update

## Validation Requirements

### Pre-deployment Checks
```markdown
Category      | Check          | Tool
--------------|---------------|-------
Environment   | State         | Status
Backup        | Verification  | Backup
Access        | Permissions   | Security
Resources     | Availability  | Monitor
Dependencies  | Compatibility | Version
```

### Post-deployment Checks
1. **Data Validation**
   - Record counts
   - Data integrity
   - Relationships
   - Constraints
   - Indexes

2. **System Validation**
   - Functionality
   - Performance
   - Integration
   - Security
   - Monitoring

## Monitoring Steps

### Deployment Monitoring
```markdown
Phase         | Focus          | Metrics
--------------|---------------|----------
Pre-deploy    | Readiness     | Status
During        | Progress      | Execution
Post-deploy   | Validation    | Success
Extended      | Performance   | Stability
```

### Monitoring Tasks
1. **Real-time**
   - Script execution
   - Error detection
   - Performance impact
   - Resource usage
   - User impact

2. **Follow-up**
   - System health
   - Performance trends
   - Error patterns
   - User feedback
   - Documentation

## Performance Checks

### Check Types
```markdown
Type          | Focus          | Threshold
--------------|---------------|------------
Response      | Query time    | < 1 second
Resources     | CPU/Memory    | < 80%
IO            | Disk usage    | < 70%
Connections   | User load     | < 90%
Blocking      | Lock time     | < 5 seconds
```

### Check Process
1. **Baseline**
   - Current metrics
   - Normal patterns
   - Peak usage
   - Resource limits
   - Performance goals

2. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time checks
   - Trend analysis
   - Alert handling
   - Issue resolution
   - Documentation

## Best Practices

### Deployment Guidelines
1. **Planning**
   - Clear process
