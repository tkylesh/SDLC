# Requirements Clarification

## Overview

Requirements clarification is the first step in the development process for a prioritized user story. This process ensures that requirements are clear, testable, and agreed upon before proceeding with development.

## Process Flow

### 1. Initial Assessment
```markdown
As a [role],
I need to [activity],
so that [business intent]
```

### 2. Background Gathering
- Current process understanding
- Problem identification
- Impact assessment
- Stakeholder identification

### 3. Business Process Documentation
- Current workflow
- Pain points
- Desired changes
- Success metrics

## Story Template

### Required Elements
```markdown
User Story ID: [Project Key from Jira]
User Story Title: [Brief summary/title]
User Story Description: [As a/I need to/so that format]
Relevant Background: [Current process, issues, impacts]
Success Criteria: [List of testable outcomes]
```

### Example Story
```markdown
User Story ID: AS-6682
User Story Title: Disallowing non-renewed risks from being written again

User Story Description: 
As an underwriter, I need to ensure that certain risk behaviors that result in 
non-renewals are mitigated by not writing policies for drivers who demonstrate 
these behaviors.

Relevant Background:
Currently, policies can be set as non-renewable for various reasons. Some 
behaviors cause non-renewal to apply to specific drivers, while others apply 
to all drivers on the policy.

Success Criteria:
1. Underwriters can mark policies as "non-renewable"
2. Reason codes must be selected
3. Driver-specific or all-driver application based on reason
4. No renewal offers generated for marked policies
5. Proper restrictions on endorsements and payments
```

## Review Process
