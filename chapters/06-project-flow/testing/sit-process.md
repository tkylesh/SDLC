# System Integration Testing (SIT) Process

## Overview

System Integration Testing (SIT) verifies that all system components work together as expected. This process ensures end-to-end functionality across integrated systems.

## SIT Environment

### Environment Setup
```markdown
1. SIT Environment Types
   - AS/SIT (AS1-AS6)
   - M-Environment (M1D1-M7D1)
   - QA Libraries

2. Environment Requirements
   - System components
   - Test data
   - Configuration
   - Access rights
```

### Data Management
```markdown
1. Test Data Setup
   - Data creation
   - Data refresh
   - Data cleanup
   - Version control

2. Data Requirements
   - Representative data
   - Edge cases
   - Error scenarios
   - Volume testing
```

## Testing Process

### 1. Entry Criteria
```markdown
1. Development Complete
   - Code deployed
   - Unit tests passed
   - Documentation ready
   - Environment ready

2. Test Preparation
   - Test cases ready
   - Test data available
   - Team assigned
   - Tools configured
```

### 2. Test Execution
```markdown
1. Integration Points
   - System interfaces
   - Data flow
   - Process flow
   - Error handling

2. End-to-End Testing
   - Business scenarios
   - User workflows
   - System processes
   - Batch operations
```

### 3. Exit Criteria
```markdown
1. Test Completion
   - All cases executed
   - Defects resolved
   - Documentation updated
   - Sign-off obtained

2. Quality Gates
   - No critical defects
   - Regression passed
   - Performance verified
   - Security validated
```

## Test Cases

### Test Case Structure
```markdown
Test Case ID: SIT-001
Title: End-to-End Policy Creation
Priority: High

Objective:
Verify complete policy creation process across all integrated systems

Pre-conditions:
- SIT environment ready
- Test data available
- Systems accessible

Test Steps:
1. Create customer record
2. Initialize policy quote
3. Add coverage details
4. Process payment
5. Issue policy
6. Verify policy documents

Expected Results:
- Policy created successfully
- All systems updated
- Documents generated
- Notifications sent

Post-conditions:
- Clean test data
- Reset system state
- Document results
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**
   - Normal flow
   - Valid data
   - Expected behavior
   - Success criteria

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - Invalid data
   - System errors
   - Timeout handling
   - Recovery process

## Defect Management

### Defect Workflow
```markdown
1. Discovery
   - Find issue
   - Document details
   - Capture evidence
   - Assign priority

2. Resolution
   - Developer fixes
   - Unit testing
   - Code review
   - Deployment

3. Verification
   - Retest fix
   - Regression test
   - Update status
   - Close defect
```

### Defect Categories
1. **Integration Issues**
   - Interface errors
   - Data mapping
   - Process flow
   - Timing issues

2. **System Issues**
   - Component failures
   - Performance problems
   - Security concerns
   - Configuration errors

## Progress Tracking

### Daily Status
```markdown
1. Test Progress
   - Cases executed
   - Pass/fail rate
   - Defect status
   - Blockers

2. Environment Status
   - System health
   - Data status
   - Access issues
   - Performance
```

### Reporting
```markdown
1. Status Reports
   - Daily summary
   - Weekly detail
   - Metrics dashboard
   - Risk assessment

2. Key Metrics
   - Test coverage
   - Defect density
   - Fix rate
   - Quality trends
```

## Best Practices

### Test Execution
1. **Process**
   - Follow test plan
   - Document results
   - Track issues
   - Regular updates

2. **Communication**
   - Daily standups
   - Status reports
   - Issue escalation
   - Team coordination

### Quality Assurance
1. **Standards**
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation
   - Evidence capture
   - Sign-off process

2. **Review**
   - Peer review
   - Quality checks
   - Process audit
   - Lessons learned
