# Testing Strategy

## Overview

The testing strategy outlines the comprehensive approach to ensuring software quality through various testing phases and methodologies.

## Testing Phases

### 1. Development Testing
```markdown
1. Unit Testing
   - Individual components
   - Isolated functionality
   - Code coverage
   - Edge cases

2. Integration Testing
   - Component interaction
   - Interface testing
   - Data flow
   - Error handling
```

### 2. System Testing
```markdown
1. System Integration Testing (SIT)
   - End-to-end flows
   - System interfaces
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing

2. Model Office Testing (MOT)
   - Business scenarios
   - Workflow validation
   - Data verification
   - Process testing
```

### 3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
```markdown
1. Business Validation
   - Requirements verification
   - Process confirmation
   - Business rules
   - User workflows

2. Production Readiness
   - Environment validation
   - Data migration
   - Performance verification
   - Security compliance
```

## Test Types

### Functional Testing
1. **Feature Testing**
   - Core functionality
   - Business rules
   - User interfaces
   - Data processing

2. **Regression Testing**
   - Existing features
   - Integration points
   - Critical paths
   - Common workflows

### Non-Functional Testing
1. **Performance Testing**
   - Response time
   - Throughput
   - Resource usage
   - Scalability

2. **Security Testing**
   - Access control
   - Data protection
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Compliance checks

## Test Planning

### Test Plan Structure
```markdown
1. Introduction
   - Purpose
   - Scope
   - Objectives
   - References

2. Test Strategy
   - Approach
   - Tools
   - Environment
   - Schedule

3. Test Cases
   - Test scenarios
   - Test steps
   - Expected results
   - Pass/fail criteria

4. Resources
   - Team members
   - Environment
   - Tools
   - Timeline
```

### Test Case Template
```markdown
Test Case ID: TC-001
Title: Verify Customer Creation
Priority: High
Module: Customer Management

Pre-conditions:
- System access
- Required permissions
- Test data available

Steps:
1. Navigate to Customer screen
2. Click "New Customer"
3. Enter required fields
4. Click "Save"

Expected Results:
- Customer created
- Confirmation message
- Database updated
- Audit log entry

Post-conditions:
- Clean test data
- Reset system state
- Log results
```

## Test Execution

### Execution Process
1. **Preparation**
   - Environment setup
   - Test data
   - Tool configuration
   - Team readiness

2. **Execution**
   - Test case runs
   - Defect logging
   - Progress tracking
   - Status reporting

3. **Review**
   - Results analysis
   - Defect triage
   - Coverage assessment
   - Quality metrics

### Test Cycles
```markdown
1. Initial Testing
   - Core features
   - Main flows
   - Critical paths
   - Basic scenarios

2. Regression Testing
   - Existing features
   - Integration points
   - Common workflows
   - Known issues

3. Final Testing
   - Full regression
   - Performance
   - Security
   - User acceptance
```

## Defect Management

### Defect Lifecycle
1. **Discovery**
   - Identification
   - Documentation
   - Classification
   - Assignment

2. **Resolution**
   - Investigation
   - Fix
   - Verification
   - Closure

### Defect Priority
```markdown
1. Critical
   - System down
   - Data corruption
   - Security breach
   - Business stop

2. High
   - Major feature
   - Significant impact
   - No workaround
   - Business affected

3. Medium
   - Minor feature
   - Partial impact
   - Workaround exists
   - Business continues

4. Low
   - Cosmetic
   - Minor impact
   - Easy workaround
   - No business impact
```

## Quality Metrics

### Key Metrics
1. **Test Coverage**
   - Code coverage
   - Feature coverage
   - Requirements coverage
   - Risk coverage

2. **Defect Metrics**
   - Defect density
   - Fix rate
   - Age analysis
   - Trend analysis

### Quality Gates
```markdown
1. Development Complete
   - Unit test coverage > 80%
   - No critical defects
   - Code review done
   - Documentation complete

2. Testing Complete
   - All test cases executed
   - No high/critical defects
   - Regression passed
   - Performance verified
```
