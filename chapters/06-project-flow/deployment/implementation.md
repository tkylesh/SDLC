# Implementation

## Overview

Implementation is the process of deploying approved changes to the production environment. This document outlines the procedures, requirements, and best practices for successful implementation.

## Implementation Process

### Pre-Implementation
```markdown
1. Final Checks
   - Deployment plan review
   - Resource confirmation
   - System readiness
   - Team availability

2. System Preparation
   - Backup verification
   - Resource allocation
   - Access control
   - Monitoring setup
```

### Implementation Steps
```markdown
1. System Shutdown
   - User notification
   - Process completion
   - System backup
   - Service stop

2. Change Deployment
   - Code deployment
   - Database updates
   - Configuration changes
   - Integration updates

3. System Startup
   - Service start
   - System check
   - Integration test
   - User notification
```

## Deployment Types

### Standard Deployment
```markdown
1. Full Deployment
   - Complete system update
   - All components
   - Full verification
   - User impact

2. Partial Deployment
   - Specific components
   - Limited scope
   - Targeted testing
   - Minimal impact
```

### Emergency Deployment
```markdown
1. Hot Fix
   - Critical issue
   - Quick response
   - Limited testing
   - High priority

2. Emergency Patch
   - Security fix
   - Compliance update
   - Immediate need
   - Risk mitigation
```
